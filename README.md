The project is a very small example of calculator. User input the basic operation and numeric, the server will parse the input and get the result of the input expression. At last, the server will give the result to the user.

The parse for the user input still have some bugs and it accept the stadard input. When user input the abnormal sequence, such as "10+*20", "10+20 20", the app will show errors. So it is only a small example and should be improved.

The idea of the project is to gather the calculation in the servers. When the user input some basic computing units, for example the algorithm of machine learning, the separate of calculation is very necessary.
